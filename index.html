        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessnðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Christopher Tran and I am currently a first-year student slated to graduate in 2025. As of right now, I am majoring in Pre-Business. However, I want to have a concentration in Business Adminstration. <br><br>

        On campus, I am involved in VSA (Vietnamese Student Association). In fall quarter I began as a general member. However, I began to get a better sense of the club and I realized that I want to be more involved. There was an opportunity to become an intern and I applied for it. After two interviews, I successfully got the position and have been an intern ever since. Being an intern has many responsibilites as well as a lot of work. One of the biggest things that intenrs do is plan social events. About two to three times a month, there is a social event and it is the responsibilites of the intern class to plan them. We do this by having weekly meetings and updating each other on what needs to be done and what has been done. This is a good way for us to keep contact with one another. On top of this, each intern has an individual role or position that they shadow. With mine being Social Chair, I specifically am in charge of fundraisers. Typically, to host a fundraiser it starts by brainstorming where the fundraiser should be. After deciding, I reach out to the organization via phone or email and inquire about hosting a fundraiser with them. If approved, then promotion needs to happen and flyers need to be made. I am the one in charge of all of that.<br><br>

        Although I joined VSA for fun, the ultimate goal of joining VSA was for me to grow as a person. Growing up, I wasn't the most outspoken person at all. Typically I would just go with the flow of others and follow them. Going into college, I knew that I had to change as a person. I realized that if I want to succeed in life then I have to be my own person. I need to be capable of making my own decisions that I am truly happy and confident about. If i were to just stay the same as I was before, it wouldn't be possible to do so. When I was debating on whether or not I should be an intern for VSA, i had the opporutnity to talk to a lot of past interns as well as current staff memebrs who are on VSA. I remember clearly, that everyone I talked to said that they grew as a person. Upon hearing that, that's when I realized that I wanted to join VSA. Although right now I am in VSA, it is not the only thing that I want to join. As of right now, joining a professional business fraterinity. Not only there, will I be able to grow my professionalism as well as my experience in working with other people, but connections can also be built. Although I would want to join one, I am still undecisive because of my schedule. I am unsure if I will be able to juggle everything from social life to grades and academics as well as my mental and physical well being.
